## Overview

My demo can be seen on the following page: https://dg-develop.github.io/Social-Media-Dashboard/

As I developed this challenge, I learned to differentiate the different ways to implement such a design. In my case, in most of them I implement Grid-Layout and a small Flex-Box.

In this challenge I learned about how use preprocessing with SASS and how to implement dark mode in one webpage, and to my knowledge, knew about React, Webpack, EsLint, Babel, and NPM.
