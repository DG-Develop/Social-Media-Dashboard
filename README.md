## Overview

![screenshot](https://i.ibb.co/yyPTbz5/2020-09-19-21h54-43.png)

My demo can be seen on the following page: https://dg-develop.github.io/404-not-found-challenge/

Now, in my experience it was an interesting challenge since I made the layout of the page with flex-box.

I learned about importing fonts and about responsive page design, and to my knowledge, knew about React, Webpack, EsLint, Babel, and NPM.
